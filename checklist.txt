Things required for alpha:
- conversations properly raise level
- dialogue prints properly
- dialogue changes after character is met
- maybe test out hint system?
- relationship maxes out properly

Things required for beta:
- end state
- dialogue options unlock based on relationship level
- have a basic school class system
- fix images if possible
- possibly give the player a specified time until the game ends
- conversation topics can't be used again once used in a conversation

probably best to spend monday-wednesday on any new additions, and spend rest on testing/polishing in time for the june 6th deadline -jake
